# js-game

[Name tba] - A Javascript game

I have decided to create a quiz game.

If eveything goes well and have time, I will turn it into a funny little "save the princess" game by answering the questions right. (like Batman in the hangman example)

You would need to get at least 80% of questions right to save (will probably have 3 hearts/lives )
